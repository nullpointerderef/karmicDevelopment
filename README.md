**<h2>Manifesto for developing technology under the principle of Karma.</h2>** 


We have concluded that technology is a collective asset powerful enough to directly and 
immediately improves or decays our universe –as we conceived it–, therefore the creative process for 
developing skills and tools – such as software, machinery, gadgets, or infrastructure – shall be governed by the following values: 

1. **Inclusion**, in which every implied or affected agent or entity <sup>[1]</sup> can contribute equally and as a 
peer<sup>[2]</sup>, avoiding hierarchies, lines of command, management obligations or reciprocity. 
2. **Causality**, where every agent must assume responsibility and acknowledge that the technological 
outcome is an instant and direct effect of the actions during development. 
3. **Decentralization**, emphasizing that something affecting a universe, must not be controlled, biased, 
or possessed by any individual entity or agent. 

Since we consider technology – and particularly software – as a living organism, thus here are the 
principles we follow: 

1. Technology is understood [and acknowledged] as a whole, integrated systemically into our world. 
Thereby, every and each result of the development process directly impacts [and is interconnected to] 
the entire microcosm and every entity in it. 

2. Interdependencies are set in such a way that every entity can play every possible role at any 
time, acting suppliers and developers as customers and users, society and consumers as sponsors, 
companies, governments and organizations as passive participants or mere lurkers, the environment 
and natural forces as the moderator<sup>[3]</sup> during certain phases of the development process; 
giving to each one of them exactly the same weight and priority for validity, success, coexistence 
and satisfaction.

3. The collective intelligence ensures a sustainable, excellent, valuable, and optimized technological 
progress, providing the ability to self-organization, self-regulation, and self-support of the entire 
process.

4. Technology evolution never ends and is continuously flowing, any attempt to define initial, fixed, 
unidirectional, or imposed requirements shall be avoided. Likewise, a final and static goal shall never 
be foreseen, established, or planned.  Instead, the aim shall be a constantly adapted, collective, and always valuable attainment. 


Every action and deed along the development process must contribute to a valuable result 
and product. Everything else, in consequence, decreases the value of the outcome and shall be dismissed.

<sup>[1]</sup> This includes consumers and people in general 

<sup>[2]</sup> Anonymity provides an equal and fair playing field. There’s no room for gender, ethnicity, 
stereotypes, or biases. Every participant gets to prove themselves on merit and can be judge only on 
their own actions. 

<sup>[3]</sup> It is currently common to assume a company or government is always the sponsor (and the 
owner) of a project, product, or technology, however people, developers, and consumers provide 
resources too – in the form of workforce, and as part of the circular flow model of money –. 
Therefore, roles shall be always interrelated, flexible and swappable along the development process.
